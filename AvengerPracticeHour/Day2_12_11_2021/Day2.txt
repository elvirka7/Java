                1.
				Given a string, return a "rotated left 2" version where the first 2 chars are moved to the end.
				The string length will be at least 2.

                input :"Hello" -> "lloHe"
                input :"java" → "vaja"
                input :"Hi" → "Hi"

                2.
                Given a string, if the string begins with "red" or "blue" print that color string,
                otherwise print the empty string.

                input :"redxx" → "red"
                input :"xxred" → ""
                input :"blueTimes" → "blue"

                3.
                Given a string, if the first or last chars are 'x', print the string without those 'x' chars,
                and otherwise print the string unchanged.
                (do with for loop)

                input :"xHix" → "Hi"
                input :"xHi" → "Hi"
                input :"Hxix" → "Hxi"



                4.
                Given a non-empty string and an int n, return a new string where the char at index n has been removed.
                The value of n will be a valid index of a char in the original string
                (do with for loop)
                input:  kitchen and 2
                output: kithen
                input:  kitchen and 0
                output: itchen

               5.
                 Given a string password. Encrypt with "x" a given password
                 and print.
                 (do with for loop)
                 password: cydeo
                 encrypt with char :x
                 output:cxyxdxexox
