							- String Methods

									charAt length

									toUpperCase() toLowerCase() trim()

									replace() replaceFirst()

									lastIndexOf() indexOf

									substring

									isEmpty

									equals Vs == Operator

									equalsIgnoreCase

							- MultiBranch If :  If(...){
							                    }else If(...){
							                    }else{
							                    }

							                        If(...){
							                        else{

							- Ternary : result: (statement)? "true statement" : "false statement"


							- Switch :  String str="...";
							            switch(str){
							               case ".." :
							                  sout();

							               default:
							                  break;
							            }



							- For Loop : for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
                                             // code block to be executed
                                            }

                                         Statement 1(initialization) is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

                                         Statement 2(condition) defines the condition for executing the code block.

                                         Statement 3(Iteration) is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

                          (FirtsTwoletter)
					/* (substring-length-isEmpty)

				      Given a string, return the string made of its first two chars, so the String "Hello" yields "He". If the string is shorter than length 2, return whatever there is, so "X" yields "X", and the empty string "" yields the empty string "".

					          Input :"Hello"   → "He"
					          Input :"abcdefg" → "ab"
					          Input :"a"	     → "a"
					          Input :""	     → "It can not be empty"
         */

					        Create a program that accepts age and weight(kg) as int.

					        If age greater than or equal 18 and weight greater than 50 kg give a message
					        	EXPECTED  :  "You are eligible to donate blood"

					        If age greater than or equal 18 and weight smaller or equal than 50 kg give a message
					        	EXPECTED  :  "You are not eligible to donate blood"

					        If age is smaller than 18 "Age must be greater than 18"
					        	EXPECTED  :  "Age must be greater than 18"

                Topic: For Loop

                       Practice 1. Factorial Number

                          /* Write a program that can return the factorial number of any given number

                              Ex:
                                  input: 5
                                  output: 120  ( because: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2* 1 = 120 )

                       Practice 2.  Fibonacci

                        /* Create a program that will give you the Fibonacci numbers up to the x value.

				           Fibonacci is a sequence of number starting from 0, 1 where the following numbers are the sum of the previous 2 numbers

			               Note: Fibonacci numbers are read as index values, so the 0th Fibonacci is 0, 1st value is 1, 2nd value is 1, etc

				          Ex:
				             Input:
				               8
				             Output:
				               0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21

                            		output:

                      /*
                       Write a program that can check if the given String is palindrome

                      			Ex:
                      				input:
                      					Level

                      				output:
