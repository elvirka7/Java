	// Big O notation is the notation that show how good your algorithm is. 
	// you can show the time complexity and space complexity using the big O notation
	// O(1)
	// O(n)

	// time complexity says how fast your code is, how good your algorithm is. 
	// O(n!) >> this is n factorial which is the worst scenario, worst option for the time complexity
	
	// general speaking if there is one loop, the time complexity is O(n)
	// if there are two loops(nested loops), the time complexity is O(n^2)
	// if there are three loops(nested loops), the time complexity is O(n^3)
