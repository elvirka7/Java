/*
create a class named LeapYear, and write a program that can identify if the given year is leap Year, print true if it's leap year, otherwise print false

	        Ex:
	             if  year = 2020

	            output:
	                2020 is leap year: true

        Hint: if the number of year can be evenly divisible by 4 (with remainder of zero), it's leap year
